			<h2>My Passion</h2>
				<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market" target="_blank">Stock Market</a></h3>
					<p>A stock market is a group of buyers and sellers of stocks, which represent ownership claims on businesses. I have been so obsessed with these stocks that I started investing in many stocks. I faced difficulties investing as I was not entitled to genuine information regarding stocks on a real-time basis. Building an efficient tool to analyze the stock markets along with real-time news is one of the many dreams that I have.</p>

			<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
				<p> This website is an online stock collection and managing center offering information, advice, and news relating to selected stocks to stock market enthusiasts who want to know the exact trends for any stock over any selected amount of time. Every user is required to create an account and login to his/her account. Users can then select any stock present in the markets. The website then displays a graph depicting the stock price and its changes over any selected period. We also provide real-time news relating to the stocks selected so that the user can decide to buy or sell the stock. Unlike other stock managing sites, which provide either news or stock prices but not both, this site will offer real-time stock prices and also news relating to all stocks selected and giving the users a broad idea of each stock so that they can decide whether to purchase that stock or not.
